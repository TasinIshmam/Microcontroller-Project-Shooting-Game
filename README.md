## Arcade Space Shooter

Brief Description: 
We made a retro inspired, vertical shooting game on the ATmega32 Microcontroller. This project was done as part of the coursework for CSE 316 (Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, Embedded Systems sessional) course. 

Instructions: 
Control and operate your ship through endless arrays of enemies trying to destroy you. Shoot them with your canon. Get combos by killing multiple enemies without getting damaged.
Survive for as long as you can.
