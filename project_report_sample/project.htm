<h2><a name="b_f">A Brief Description</a></h2>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">
In this Project we have designed a space shooting game similar to the ones found in the earlier Nokia phones, where there is a spaceship, controlled by the player. The ship needs to destroy the approaching enemies. In case of a collision with the enemy, it loses some health. After loss of a certain amount of health, the game overs.<br/><br/>
LED matrix is used to show the game board, and LCD display module is used to show other information. Gyroscope is used to move the ship. Two ATmega32 microprocessors powers the whole system.

<h2><a name="h_w">How it works?</a></h2>
<hr />
<p  style="text-align:justify;">If you are also a 90's kid like us, you must remember growing up playing those awesome games on your parents first phones! Ah, how great those days were! We have created this game to remind you those lost golden days. In this game you, the player, run a spaceship. You can control which direction you are going. There are enemies/objects approaching you (or you approaching them)! A collision with any of those objects is very deadly for your spaceship. </p>

<p  style="text-align:justify;">The easiest way to continue moving is to destroy these objects as you find them. You can shoot at a certain interval to destroy them. Destroying them increases your score in intergalactic tourist rank, because, guess what, you are making future journeys easier for others! However, you can't always destroy your enemies, as they can sometimes find out a way to stay out of your range. And in that case you need to avoid them, of course. I am telling you again, a collision may be very deadly for your spaceship, as you may forget. You may somehow survive one, two or three, but the best ship available in the universe right now (yes, that's yours!) survive five such collisions :'(</p>

<p  style="text-align:justify;">There are some minor details in the game. You can see your intergalactic tourist score in the LCD display we have here. You can also see how many collisions you afford before your spaceship breaks. You can also get bonus points when you manage to destroy 5 enemies in a row without harming your ship.

<ol >
  <li>Start</li>
  <li>Calibrate the Gyroscope for 15-20 seconds</li>
  <li>Detect input from gyroscope, move ship according to input</li>
  <li>Activate deactived bullet if fixed time has passed since last shooting and button is clicked</li>
  <li>Calculate the postions of all the objects in game borad</li>
  <li>Increase score if any killed enemy is detected</li>
  <li>Decrease health if a collision is detected</li>
  <li>If health is 0, go to Step 10</li>
  <li>Go to step 3</li>
  <li>End</li>

<h2><a name="p_f">Problems Faced</a></h2>
<hr />

<ol>
  <li><p style="text-align:justify;">After we had finished writing the codes for our project we designed the circuit in Proteus simulator. Everything was working as expected. However, when we implemented the same circuit in hardware, it was not working. We tried to find out reason, but didn't find any. Finally a tweak in the codebase let us solve the problem.</p></li>
    
  <li><p style="text-align:justify;">After we had connected both the bicolor LED matrices, they started to behave randomly due to voltage fluctuation, caused by wire connections getting loose after a movement.</p></li>
    
  <li><p style="text-align:justify;">Initially we had written the whole codebase in C++. But the library that we used to interface our gyroscope with ATmega32 module was written in C. Compiling both using the same compiler created some compatibility issues, which was fixed by compiling the C code with a C compiler and using a different ATmega32 for that.</p></li>
